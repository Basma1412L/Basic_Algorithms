To make the sum the maximum I noticed that the difference between the 2 numbers in the same level is maximum 1
so I used merge sort because its complexity is o(nlogn) then i passed on the number if its odd i will use the first digit for the the extra level in the first number
then for the equal digits i will take the maximum for the first number then the post one to the second number and so on

the complexity is o(nlogn) for the sorting and o(n) for forming the numbers so toal= o(nlogn)
