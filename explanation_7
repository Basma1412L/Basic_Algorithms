The RouteTrieNode is similar to the trienode but instead of the letters it adds words
the insert method create new nodes with the words values and add the children array of the trie node.

The Roottrie is initiated by creating a root whisch is a RouteTrieNode
It inserts by hecking if the node exists or not and at the end it adds the handler
for the find method it checks all the children of the root and  return the handler that exists at the end node

The Router class makes use of the previous classes for adding handlers.
whenever a new handler is added first is splited up using the "/" then it is passed to the insert function of the RootTrie
The lookup method also splits the route first the pass it to  the find method in the RooTTrie


Complexity of adding handler or looking up are both o(n)
