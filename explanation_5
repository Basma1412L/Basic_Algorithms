To find all the suffixes I created two functions. The find functiond find all the suffixes of the given letter then the all_suffices
function will recurse on all the suffixes resulted from find and keep appending the suffixes when word is completed

complexity of find is o(n)
complextity of allsuffixes is o(nk) where k is the number of children
